<h1 align="left">Hi! I'm Anirudh. It's nice to meet you. ðŸ‘‹</h1>

<h2 align="left">About Me ðŸ‘¨</h2>

<p align="left">I'm a front-end developer passionate about creating beautiful and functional web applications. My expertise includes HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript.

I have a strong understanding of front-end development principles and have gained experience in building responsive and user-friendly web pages. I love using React to create dynamic user interfaces and manage state, and I have a talent for merging HTML and CSS to craft visually appealing layouts. Additionally, I have experience in integrating front-end components with Ruby on Rails back-end systems.

I've worked on various projects, both small and large-scale. From start to finish, I bring my skills in using version control systems (such as Git) and my focus on writing clean, maintainable, and well-documented code to every project.

I'm a lifelong learner and am committed to staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends and best practices. Collaboration is key for me, and I enjoy working with others to find creative solutions to technical challenges.

If you're looking for a front-end developer who brings passion, experience, and a love for HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript to the table, then I'm your guy! Let's work together and build something amazing!</p>
